General options
--help				Print help message.
--file <file>		Read from this file.
(future) --type <t>	Type of database. For now, the only supported type is INVENT.

How to select parts (type INVENT only):
(only one of each may be specified for now.)

--match-all					All parts match.
--match-regex <regex>		Check regex against part number.
--match-regex-all <regex>	Check regex against part number, description, extended description (and hopefully notes as well).
--match-partno <partno>		Match part number (fuzzy match - ignore whitespace and dashes)
--match-vendor <vendor>		Match vendor.
--match-bin <bin>			Match primary bin location.


And then let's act on whatever parts matched;
multiple actions *shall* be run.
	
	--update-qty-db <filename>		If the on-hand quantity has changed, update the DB to match.
	--print	(text|json)				Print the parts as text or JSON.


On error, an appropriate error message is printed as plain text on stderr and EXIT_FAILURE is returned.
